  title "The IIS 8.5 web server must use a logging mechanism that is configured
to allocate log record storage capacity large enough to accommodate the logging
requirements of the IIS 8.5 web server."
  desc  "In order to make certain that the logging mechanism used by the web
server has sufficient storage capacity in which to write the logs, the logging
mechanism needs to be able to allocate log record storage capacity.

    The task of allocating log record storage capacity is usually performed
during initial installation of the logging mechanism. The system administrator
will usually coordinate the allocation of physical drive space with the web
server administrator along with the physical location of the partition and
disk. Refer to NIST SP 800-92 for specific requirements on log rotation and
storage dependent on the impact of the web server.
